- ⚡ Fun fact: The T-34/85 tank, a significant upgrade from the earlier T-34/76, played a crucial role in the Soviet Union's success during World War II.
- One interesting aspect of the T-34/85 is that it was equipped with a powerful 85mm gun, which was capable of penetrating the armor of the German Panther and Tiger tanks.
- This upgrade significantly boosted the combat effectiveness of the T-34 series, making it one of the most formidable tanks of the war.
- Additionally, the T-34/85's design was so effective that it continued to be used by various countries well into the late 20th century, long after World War II had ended.
